# 🐧 Netbook Linux

**Netbook Linux** is a personal remix of Debian 12 tailored for low-spec netbooks, especially Intel Atom-era machines. It’s optimized for speed, practicality, and hands-on learning.

## 🎯 Goals

- Lightweight and responsive GUI (LXQt or Openbox)
- Minimized background services and memory usage
- Daily driver apps: web, writing, coding, and microcontroller dev
- Practical sysadmin tools for Linux+ certification prep

## 📁 Project Structure
scripts/ → Custom install and config scripts
docs/ → Notes, logs, and design decisions
configs/ → Manual tweaks (e.g., theming, system settings)

## 🚧 Status

> This is a work in progress, not a ready-made distro. It’s a personal learning project being built live and iteratively.
